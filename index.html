<div class="container">
<p class="orange" > My name is Tracy Demarest and I am a former Physical Education and Health Teacher who switched careers to work in retail. 
I'm getting my master's degree in instructional design in order to work for a company's learning and development department.
I enjoy the following activities in no particular order:</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
<ul>
<li><strong>Traveling</strong>- We love going to the Caribean Islands and exploring. Our favorite so far has been Aruba because the locals are so welcoming and truly happy. In the future, our plans are to explore Europe next!</li>   
<li><strong>Sports</strong>- I used to play softball in college as well as MMA fighting. While I don't currently play sports, I am looking to join a new Dojo and work to get my black belt some day in the near future. When I can, I love going to live events. Especially when I'm back home in NJ, you can find me going to a NJ Devils hockey game or driving into NYC to watch the NY Mets play.</li>
<li><strong>Red wine</strong>- I love going to wineries and hope I'll get to the Willamette Valley someday. Until then, we will keep enjoying the vineyards that NC has to offer. We have been to over 25 and typically partake in ones that produce dryer reds as opposed to the sweeter variety.</li>    
<li><strong>Hiking</strong>- There's a place in Charlotte called Crowder Mountain which is a great place to hike. Once you get to the top that sense of accomplishment is like no other.</li>
<li><strong>My animals</strong>- I have three dogs and two cats. Two of our dogs were adopted from the shelter. One is a pit mix named Arthur and the other is a Malti-Poo named Teddy. Mia is a Westie who enjoys bossing her brothers around. My two black cats Mardie and Parker were rescued as well. I'd save a million if I could however, five is enough for now!</li>  
<li><strong>Working out</strong>- I own a Peloton and this was the best decision ever! Just the sheer convenience promotes a more active lifestyle.</li>
</ul>

		<h1>Favorite Ed Tech Tools</h1>
<ul>
<li><h2>Flip Grid</h2>
<p class="yellow" > This is one of two tools that I've become familiar with so far and I've only used it once so far though I anticpate using it much more often.
I enjoy the ability to record responses via video. This can be helpful when distance learning comes into play at my organization.</p>
  </li>
<li><h2>Camtasia</h2>
<p class="purple" > This was the first tool that I had the opportunity to use and I love that I can create how-to videos for my team.
I also appreciate the fact that you can capture video while performing actions on the computer.</p>
